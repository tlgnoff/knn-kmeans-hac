## KNN

To run K-Nearest Neighbor program:

` python knn.py `

Program will produce plot and save the image.

Best k and accuracy on the test set with that k will be printed to the standard output.

## K-means

To run program that produces plots of k vs. objective function:

`python kmeans.py`

Program will generate and save images as "kmeans_plot##.png" where ## is the id number of clustering.


To run program that produces results:

`python kmeans_results.py`

Program will generate and save images as "plot_res##.png" where ## is the id number of clustering.

#### HAC

To run HAC program:

`python hac.py`

Program will generate and save images as "part3_plot_#data_#criterion.png" where #data is the id number of data and #criterion is the id number of criterion:

* Single-Linkage Criterion = 1
* Complete-Linkage Criterion = 2
* Average-Linkage Criterion = 3
* Centroid Criterion = 4
